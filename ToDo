File a bug against PyScript about UI freezing when large image is resized in a worker

workerlib
- Add documentation on remote module
- Describe "minimum mode" with unpacking JsProxies and that's all, can be used for other languages too. Switch off adapters, that's it?
+ Add "unsafe" adapter for unsafe types only - maybe "Any" should do that? Adapters are for unknown classes, so looks like this is the right way
/ Add "pickle" calling sub-worker, inherits the previous one
+ Add checking constructor arguments when creating None encoder

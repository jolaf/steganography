File a bug against PyScript about UI freezing when large image is resized in a worker
When replacing any image, kill everything below the chain (still not working!)

workerlib
+ Mention Micropython is not supported as code is Python 3.13
- Add documentation on remote module
- Describe "minimum mode" with unpacking JsProxies and that's all, can be used for other languages too. Switch off adapters, that's it?
+ Add "pickle" encoder/decoder for adapters
- Add "unsafe" adapter for unsafe types only - maybe "Any" should do that? Adapters are for unknown classes, so looks like this is the right way
+ Add "anyCall" calling sub-worker, enable it from worker side. Sends (funcName, args, kwargs) as a single structure
- Add "pickle" calling sub-worker, inherits the previous one
+ ["Enum", "None", "None"] - for any Enums, mention in doc
- Add checking constructor arguments when creating None encoder
